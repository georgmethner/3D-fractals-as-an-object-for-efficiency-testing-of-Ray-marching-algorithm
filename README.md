# 3D fractals as an object for efficiency testing of Ray-marching algorithm (school paper) (corrupted)
My project for the school paper I had to write in 11th grade. 
It is availible right [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9xGHNO5_mVNJu9sBTJJw5eU8aziU-uInwm71qki0t8/edit?usp=sharing), it is in german though.
Sadly the project files are corrupted, but at least these are the last remains.
The project was about rendering and coloring fractals. There is also a video of me exploring the fractal [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z6kKDV9kBI&t=76s). It described two different rendering techniques and compared both of them.
The two rendering techniques were classic raymarching and the dda-algorithm (usually used to render voxels)
Here are some pictures of the results:
