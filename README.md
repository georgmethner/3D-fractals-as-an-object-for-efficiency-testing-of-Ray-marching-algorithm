# 3D Fractals: An Object for Efficiency Testing of the Ray Marching Algorithm (School Paper)

This repository encapsulates my 11th-grade school paper, which delves into the exploration of 3D fractals as a foundational element for evaluating the efficiency of the Ray Marching algorithm. Unfortunately, the project files are no longer accessible due to corruption; however, remnants of the project, along with the academic paper, are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9xGHNO5_mVNJu9sBTJJw5eU8aziU-uInwm71qki0t8/edit?usp=sharing) (in German).

In essence, the project centered around the rendering and coloring of fractals. A visual exploration of the fractal can be witnessed in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z6kKDV9kBI&t=76s). The paper systematically presented and compared two distinct rendering techniques: classic raymarching and the DDA algorithm, typically employed for rendering voxels.

Despite the regrettable corruption of the project files, accompanying visuals of the achieved results are presented below.
