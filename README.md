# 3D-fractals-as-an-object-for-efficiency-testing-of-Ray-marching-algorithm

Greetings! This repository houses my 11th-grade school project, an exploration into the realm of 3D fractals as a subject for evaluating the efficiency of the Ray Marching algorithm. Sadly, the project files have encountered some corruption issues, although the academic paper can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9xGHNO5_mVNJu9sBTJJw5eU8aziU-uInwm71qki0t8/edit?usp=sharing) (in German).

In essence, the project focused on the rendering and coloring of fractals. A visual representation of the fractal journey can be found in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z6kKDV9kBI&t=76s). The paper systematically presented and compared two distinct rendering techniques: classic raymarching and the DDA algorithm, which is normally used for voxel rendering.

Despite the unfortunate corruption of the project files, snapshots showcasing the achieved results are presented below.
